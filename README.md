# Unity-Car-Controller

## What Is This
This is a simple car controller that can be used in unity.
It is basically a car controller in 2 (3 if you want to make it sophisticated) scripts instead of 4 or 5 scripts.

## Why I Made This
I made it so people don't have to spend hours searching for a car controller that is customizable and easy to implement.

## Dependencies
There is only 1 dependency, that is if you use the speedometer script, which is Text Mesh Pro (TMP)

## Current Features
1. Basic movement
2. Drifting
3. Skid marks and particle effects
4. Boost
5. Lights (Brake Lights, Headlights and Reverse Lights)
6. Audio System (Not Very Good, still bad and full of bugs)
7. Gear System
8. Speedometer
9. Radio
